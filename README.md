My journey to building a busy light with a Raspberry Pi.

[Full guide in my blog](https://blog.tzwaeaen.de)


## Summary

I set out to build a presence indicator for the office, all while navigating the challenges of a pretty restrictive IT environment. The presence detection relies on Teams log files (yes, it works with the new Teams) and a PowerShell script handles the extraction. The Raspberry Pi is connected via USB, which provides power and exposes the Pi as a drive. The PowerShell script updates the status file on this drive, while a Python script running on the Pi monitors the file for changes and adjusts the LED colors accordingly.
